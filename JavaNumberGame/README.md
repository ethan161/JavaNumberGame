# Overview

This software is a "guess the numbers" game, allowing you to find the hidden number given to you by the program.

I wrote this program to get a deeper understanding of the java language and practice my learning skills.

The java language was used to write this, with the libraries ArrayList, Random, Scanner, and *.

# Future Work

- I didn't get to multiple difficulties, such as the enter key not providing as much information, or being able to choose the range of numbers you wanted to play would be in.
- Another thing I would add is adding more classes. This would help the program read better.
- I could also clean up my if statements, and put in a switch case statement.
